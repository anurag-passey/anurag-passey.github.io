                        My name is Anurag Passey. I am a highly motivated professional seeking to enhance my knowledge and competence in the field of Data Science. In the intricate and interconnected world of international businesses, education, politics or any other field for that matter, the science of Data inundates our lives on day to day basis. This inspires me to earn aptitude and prowess in the field. Staggering volume of existing data, the ever-accelerating rate of the current & future data genesis and the potential for automation captivates me immensely to use my analytical and technical skills for advancement of information intensive industries.

						Right from the initial years of my middle school I was curious about the workings of a computer and always used to dig deeper into any relevant knowledge source to understand the technicalities of the computer system. Being a meritorious student at school and foreseeing promising prospects in the field, I was encouraged to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the renowned college of my home country. Following my bachelors, I got a promising opportunity to work for Accenture which is which is a leading consulting corporation. To take my education and learnings to the next level I decided to join Conestoga college and I am confident in my preparations and determined to achieve my career goal.  I have never allowed myself to be consumed completely by books. Apart from having good scholastics record, I have also amassed a rich experience in numerous extracurricular events ranging from participating to organizing multiple cultural & sports events and technical workshops.

Understanding the concepts of the field motivated me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in the field of computer science. After completing my high school, I got a promising opportunity to join Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNE) which is one of the oldest and prestigious engineering institute in my country. GNE is the first college from the province of Punjab to acquire the autonomous status and is among the very few institutes of the country to get financial assistance from the world bank under the TEQIP program.

                <p align="justify">
                My undergrad college has a good rapport among many multinational corporate firms, and they visit our college campus consistently to hire potential students. During the last year of my bachelor's, our college campus organized a placement drive which was visited by one of my dream companies, Accenture. As a result of my hard work, consistency, impressive academic record, and growth promise in the software engineering field, I was recruited as a Software Engineer at Accenture.
				Joining Accenture was a huge breakthrough for my professional career and my employment at Accenture has allowed me to learn and grow as an IT professional by understanding business processes, developing code, and providing support and maintenance for software across various technologies. Furthermore, I have interacted with clients to understand their business process flow, assessing, and analyzing the usability of their current processes and suggested feasible changes to improve the efficiency of the overall process. I have also been a part of the development team responsible for creating KPI’s dashboard providing clients with deeper insights into their ongoing processes. My work has been recognized several times by the client and, I have received several appreciation mails and have won performer of the month award for my diligent efforts. Alongside the work, I have been part of many firm initiatives by Accenture and organized knowledge transfer sessions for the new joiners in our project. In these initial years of my professional career, I have enjoyed my responsibilities and have pounced on any opportunity to innovate and make a difference.

Through my proximity to business processes and interaction with clients as well as the more experienced colleagues; I recognized that data is the new currency especially for a corporation looking to expand and grow.

						A corporation that gives proper attention to curating, preserving, and mobilizing its data has a great potential of exponential growth.

Not only does this provide promising career opportunities but I feel that I immensely intrigued by data analytics as well. Learning the methodologies, fundamental principles as well as the many tricks of the trade; all of these activities are very engaging for me. Being a data analyst is something that I am passionate about and it also aligns perfectly with my ambitions of having an influential career in Technology.

					After completing the ITBA course, I desire to join an elite corporation as a business analyst.

Since my school days, I have always cherished helping my friends and with time I have realized that I'm good at mentoring people so, after becoming an expert in my domain I would love to mentor new talent entering into my field of expertise.

                       I believe the most important strength that must be possessed by any professional is to analyze oneself and identify what skills they lack in and how to acquire these to achieve the desired results. Continuous process of self evaluation has enabled me to grow through out my academic and professional career. I posses a relentless curiosity which allows me to continuously learn and therefore consistently grow. This coupled with my discipline and a collaborative nature has helped me to carry out my responsibilities successfully. Throughout my career I have always acknowledged the importance of teamwork, by working in a team one can learn from their fellow teammate's different ways to approach a problem which in turn increases the probability of the success of the project and enhances the decision-making process. In my last project I was always looking forward to helping other team members in whatever possible way I could because each time I used to transfer my knowledge to my teammate I would learn new things. I consider this helping nature of mine as one of my biggest assets and I see myself mentoring newcomers entering the field of analytics in the later part of my career.

						Since childhood I have never felt nervous in communicating with other people and with time, I have realized this instinct of mine is an important life skill and I have harnessed this ability of mine to the vey best. Being a detail oriented professional along with strong communication skill set has enabled me to perform the requirement gathering process effectively.
